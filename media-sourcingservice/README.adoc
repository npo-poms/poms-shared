== Issues when using openapi generator

- operationId are ids  UUID

NOTE: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/
Some common use cases for operationId are:``
Some code generators use this value to name the corresponding methods in code.
Links can refer to the linked operations by operationId.``

Generated code is therefore pretty much horrible.


Code has no form of validation. If I send an empty ingest request, I'll simply cause errors in de poms log.

- 'multipart' api seems rather particular
[source, java]
----
  public Object fe2878922c15ec40d930bec65724f0c7(String mid, String uploadPhase, String fileSize, File fileChunk) throws ApiException{
----

- type of parameters seems sometimes a bit off:

[source, json]
----
"file_size": {
"description": "description",
"type": "string"
}
----


- or missing altogether in openapi spec: ('email')

- at last: https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/2054

This does it. Client generation is not useable for this api


== Direct implementation

So, we'll keep it simple, and the following will be our approach

There are only 2 calls of importance for now

/ingest

* talks to our backend api (it shouldn't)
* it registers a 'callback_url'  (I don't see the point)

/ingest/<mid>/multipart[-assetonly]

-  uploads the actual file, via 3 or more https multipart (!) posts.

We now are implementing it just with an `java.net.http.HttpClient`. See `nl.vpro.sourcingservice.SourcingServiceImpl`

If you try this, the last call will fail notifying us that no callback_url was available.

When using the `-assetonly` variant the only feedback to POMS seems to be a call on /exists. This is acceptable, but uncomfortable (and superflouous), because we have 3 environments and there are only 2 for the sourcing service which are tightly linked to production and acceptation environments. Hence, the full route can't be made working fulling on the test environment.

== GEO restrictions

Georestictions (on region) can be supplied and should end up in the 'redirect service'. Oddly, that can happen on both the ingest and the -assetonly endpoints. For now it is supplied on all these, but I could not confirm that it actually works yet.

== Other type of restrictions


We also could have other restrictions, like 'portal' restrictions and age restrictions.

=== Portal-restrictions
Portal restrictions  hard to enforce. Perhaps the redirect service could do something with content security policies. It always used to be just meta-data. If a certain poms item has a portal restriction, but is used elsewhere, that only human interactions could resolve that.

=== Age restrictions
Age restrictions could have influence on the time of the day that something is playable. E.g. if content is not suitable for children, it could only be viewed or listened after 19:00. This is not implemented yet, at least not in the redirect service or sourcing service (which are responsible for audio)
