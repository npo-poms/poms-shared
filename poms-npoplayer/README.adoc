== NPO Player 9

The needed backend for NPO Player 9 just involves calculating a JWT-token.
[source, java]
----
import nl.vpro.npoplayer9.*;
import org.meeuw.math.time.TestClock;
...

 TokenFactory npoPlayer9 = new TokenFactory(
     "vpro",
     "123123123123123123123123123123123123123123123"
).withClock(TestClock.twentyTwenty());

String token = npoPlayer9.token("mid_123");
assertThat(token).isEqualTo("eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJtaWRfMTIzIiwiaWF0IjoxNTgyMjI2NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJ2cHJvIn0.8tPo7XlEWpvtChBZgx8WOalprRHqypSoQsCyY2baB1w");

There is also a link:src/main/java/nl/vpro/npoplayer9/NpoPlayer.java[`NpoPlayer`] class that wraps such a factory with some extra information that needs configuration.

A link:src/main/resources/META-INF/vpro/poms-npoplayer9.xml[Spring configuration file] is provided to arrange this as injectable spring beans.
