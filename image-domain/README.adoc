== taglib

This jar also provided a tag-library.

This example is JSPX. Tag-libraries are useable in normal JSP or e.g. FreeMarker too. Change syntax accordingly then.

== Conversions

We provide (since 7.2) also some functionality to _predict_ sizes before actual conversions.

It is implemented, in java,  in link:./src/main/java/nl/vpro/domain/convert/Conversions.java[this class]

It uses link:src/main/resources/image-conversions.properties[this resource] (which is also served via https://images.poms.omroep.nl/properties)

I would of course be feasible to make this available in different languages, which we may consider on request.
