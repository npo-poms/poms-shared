== build

This is automatically build on github.


Basically it's just
[source, bash]
====
 michiel@mitulo:~/github/npo-poms/poms-shared$ mvn
 [INFO] Scanning for projects...
 [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The github build can be done locally with 'https://github.com/nektos/act[act]'. Create a file '${USER.HOME}/.secrets' (a propertyfile with the secrets of this project) and then:

[source, bash]
====
 michiel@mitulo:~/github/npo-poms/poms-shared$ act
 [build/build] 🚀  Start image=nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04

== Maven versioning

We are in a kind of hybrid situation
For `main` we use link:https://maven.apache.org/maven-ci-friendly.html['CI friendly' versioning] (using `revision` and `changelist` properties).

For release branches this is overridden by the release:branch plugin

This means that open pull requests (on `main`) will result in artifacts on sonatype snapshots that have the name of the branch in their version.  They can be used in associated merge requests in other projects (likely one of the poms projects in the VPRO gitlab repository)


== Releasing

Make sure SNAPSHOT are resolved. Furthermore, it's similar to as described in https://github.com/npo-poms/poms-parent/blob/main/RELEASE.adoc:[poms parent].
