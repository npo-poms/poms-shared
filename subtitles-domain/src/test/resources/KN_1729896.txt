1:       00:02:06:16 00:02:10:02 03:11
Europe is feverishly looking
for natural gas.

2:       00:02:10:05 00:02:12:17 02:12
The US is eager to supply.

3:       00:02:22:15 00:02:25:05 02:15
An LNG boom.

4:       00:02:25:08 00:02:28:18 03:10
Made possible by the largest Dutch bank.

5:       00:02:28:21 00:02:30:10 01:14
But at what price?

6:       00:02:34:00 00:02:39:08 05:08
Pointer about fossil fuel investments
in times of climate change.

- Leaving Pistoolhaven for Berenkanaal...

10:      00:02:56:23 00:03:00:15 03:17
...taking a film crew to the LNG carrier.

11:      00:03:00:18 00:03:02:03 01:10
Yes, OK.

12:      00:03:03:07 00:03:07:22 04:15
There you see the LNG terminal,
those three concrete tanks.

13:      00:03:08:00 00:03:14:00 06:00
The Metropolis will dock there.
She sailed from Lake Charles in the US.

14:      00:03:17:21 00:03:22:04 04:08
It's very hazardous cargo,
so she is being towed.

15:      00:03:24:18 00:03:31:13 06:20
The terminal is near the sea to keep LNG
ships as far from other ships as possible.

16:      00:03:31:16 00:03:34:01 02:10
This is the edge of the port of Rotterdam.

17:      00:03:37:14 00:03:41:22 04:08
The new gold is called LNG,
Liquefied Natural Gas.

18:      00:03:42:00 00:03:48:05 06:05
Due to the war with Ukraine, Europe is
looking for alternatives for Russian gas.

19:      00:03:55:11 00:04:01:06 05:20
Carriers like the Diamond Metropolis
carry tonnes of liquid gas to Rotterdam.

20:      00:04:01:09 00:04:07:11 06:02
One quarter is for the Dutch gas reserve,
the rest is transhipped elsewhere.

21:      00:04:07:14 00:04:09:23 02:09
We've seen record transhipment.

22:      00:04:10:01 00:04:14:01 04:00
Before, we transhipped
seven million tonnes yearly.

23:      00:04:14:04 00:04:20:03 05:24
If the present trend continues, it will be
over ten million tonnes. That's a record.

24:      00:04:20:06 00:04:23:18 03:12
This LNG boom generates our interest.

25:      00:04:23:21 00:04:28:04 04:08
Compared to 2016, the year
after the Paris Accords were signed...

26:      00:04:28:07 00:04:31:24 03:17
...the Netherlands now imports
eight times more LNG.

27:      00:04:32:02 00:04:35:18 03:16
A boom supported by eager investors...

28:      00:04:35:21 00:04:40:05 04:09
...in a time in which we need
to reduce our carbon footprint.

29:      00:04:40:08 00:04:43:21 03:13
We researched the financing
of LNG terminals.

30:      00:04:43:24 00:04:50:19 06:20
These contribute a lot to climate change,
because they use up a lot of energy...

31:      00:04:50:22 00:04:55:20 04:23
...to liquefy the gas.
Thanks to a tip we found out...

32:      00:04:55:23 00:05:01:13 05:15
...ING finances LNG projects
on a massive scale.

33:      00:05:01:16 00:05:07:06 05:15
Especially those terminals.
That's why we started tracing the money.

34:      00:05:07:09 00:05:11:00 03:16
The money trail leads us to the US.

35:      00:05:11:03 00:05:17:14 06:11
This year the US supplanted Qatar
as the world's leading LNG exporter.

36:      00:05:17:17 00:05:22:14 04:22
Since Paris the US's export capacity
has increased fourteen fold.

37:      00:05:22:17 00:05:28:17 06:00
The country already has seven
LNG terminals and is building more.

38:      00:05:28:20 00:05:35:16 06:21
In four years the US will probably be able
to export 400,000 tonnes of LNG per day.

39:      00:05:36:21 00:05:41:16 04:20
There is a powerful LNG lobby
in the USA.

40:      00:05:41:19 00:05:46:17 04:23
LNG Allies, the lobby group
for the American LNG industry...

41:      00:05:46:20 00:05:51:10 04:15
...one day after the invasion of Ukraine
sent a letter to Joe Biden...

42:      00:05:51:13 00:05:58:09 06:21
...with demands and tips concerning
further growth of the LNG industry.

43:      00:05:58:12 00:06:05:06 06:19
To draw investors, guarantees are
needed, LNG Allies wrote in February.

44:      00:06:05:09 00:06:12:10 07:01
Export applications need quick approval
and we need more pipelines to terminals.

45:      00:07:04:03 00:07:08:06 04:03
But Louisiana residents
suffer the consequences...

46:      00:07:08:09 00:07:11:04 02:20
...of the LNG industry's advance.

47:      00:07:40:00 00:07:46:13 06:13
John Allaire lives in this area where
LNG terminals are built at record speeds.

48:      00:07:46:16 00:07:50:16 04:00
Near Houston and New Orleans
five facilities...

49:      00:07:50:19 00:07:56:18 05:24
...ready the shale gas from the interior
for transport. More are planned.

50:      00:08:03:19 00:08:09:14 05:20
Allaire, a former environmental
consultant, leads the resistance.

51:      00:09:16:24 00:09:21:20 04:21
The Mississippi Delta,
where ten LNG terminals are planned...

52:      00:09:21:23 00:09:25:15 03:17
...is already hit by the consequences
of climate change.

53:      00:09:25:18 00:09:29:15 03:22
The marshlands are shrinking
because of rising sea levels...

54:      00:09:29:18 00:09:34:22 05:04
...and because the Mississippi levies
impede the deposit of sediments.

55:      00:09:35:00 00:09:39:12 04:12
At this pace, in 30 years
this area will be below sea level.

56:      00:09:43:17 00:09:49:23 06:06
On top of that, the area is in the path
of an increasing number of hurricanes.

57:      00:10:17:11 00:10:18:23 01:12
These grim prospects...

58:      00:10:19:01 00:10:24:07 05:06
...do not stop the financial sector
from massive investments in LNG.

59:      00:10:24:10 00:10:28:07 03:22
The question is: Who pays
for these mega gas factories.

60:      00:10:37:18 00:10:42:24 05:06
We were tipped about large-scale
financing by ING of LNG terminals.

61:      00:10:43:02 00:10:47:21 04:19
But they are very quiet about that.
No press releases.

62:      00:10:47:24 00:10:52:17 04:18
We checked a database
that is difficult to access...

63:      00:10:52:20 00:10:59:00 06:05
...hiring a partner to provide
the necessary data. These showed...

64:      00:10:59:03 00:11:02:04 03:01
...that ING is a very big player.

65:      00:11:02:07 00:11:07:12 05:05
In fact, ING is the third biggest
investor in American LNG.

66:      00:11:07:15 00:11:12:05 04:15
The bank has a stake in nine of
the ten terminals that will be running.

67:      00:11:12:08 00:11:14:20 02:12
Over four billion dollars in investments...

68:      00:11:14:23 00:11:20:11 05:13
...since the Paris Accords meant
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

69:      00:11:20:14 00:11:25:01 04:12
And just short of seven billion dollars
in total.

70:      00:11:25:04 00:11:29:15 04:11
These terminals
use huge amounts of energy.

71:      00:11:29:18 00:11:34:11 04:18
Tata Steel is the biggest polluter
in the Netherlands.

72:      00:11:34:14 00:11:42:07 07:18
Some of the factories that produce LNG
pollute as much as Tata Steel, or more.

73:      00:12:00:02 00:12:05:07 05:05
How do ING reconcile these fossil
investments with their climate goals?

74:      00:12:05:10 00:12:08:09 02:24
We ask the bank for an interview.

75:      00:12:08:12 00:12:13:15 05:03
We prefer to respond in writing
and not in front of a camera.

76:      00:12:13:18 00:12:16:00 02:07
But why?

77:      00:12:17:04 00:12:21:17 04:13
We see little added value
in an on-camera interview.

78:      00:12:21:20 00:12:25:24 04:04
Sure, but we can't do much with an email.

79:      00:12:27:20 00:12:30:06 02:11
That's my dilemma.

80:      00:12:30:09 00:12:36:11 06:02
There are ways to use written responses
on TV. You'll find a solution.

81:      00:12:36:14 00:12:38:11 01:22
OK, let's try.

82:      00:12:38:14 00:12:44:10 05:21
ING say they invested less in LNG,
but they won't say how much less.

83:      00:12:44:13 00:12:50:06 05:18
These loans are in line with their goal
of climate neutrality in 2050, say ING.

84:      00:12:50:09 00:12:55:00 04:16
LNG exploration is no longer financed,
but LNG transport is...

85:      00:12:55:03 00:12:58:23 03:20
...to shore up energy security.

86:      00:12:59:01 00:13:05:12 06:11
'The war in Ukraine has given this last
factor an extra dimension recently.'

87:      00:13:05:15 00:13:08:11 02:21
We do not deny we'll need gas tomorrow.

88:      00:13:08:14 00:13:15:02 06:13
But when you finance new projects
or companies that plan new projects...

89:      00:13:15:05 00:13:19:04 03:24
...that contravenes the Paris Accords.

90:      00:13:19:07 00:13:24:03 04:21
Maaike Beenes works at BankTrack.
They check whether bank investments...

91:      00:13:24:06 00:13:27:08 03:02
...are in line with climate accords.

92:      00:13:27:11 00:13:32:19 05:08
A recent report states that
new LNG terminals are not needed...

93:      00:13:32:22 00:13:39:12 06:15
...in a 1.5-degree scenario. It takes four
years for new projects to come online...

94:      00:13:39:15 00:13:45:10 05:20
...and to start delivering. So, they will
not help us this winter or the next.

95:      00:13:45:13 00:13:50:18 05:05
What we need
is much more renewable energy.

96:      00:13:50:21 00:13:54:12 03:16
If we continue to invest
in LNG infrastructure...

97:      00:13:54:15 00:13:59:19 05:04
...we are stuck with it for 20 or 30 years
while it doesn't solve the present crisis.

98:      00:13:59:22 00:14:05:08 05:11
The IPCC also researches whether banks
do enough to stop global warming.

99:      00:14:05:11 00:14:11:20 06:09
The U.N.'s climate panel advocates
a drastic reduction of gas extraction...

100:     00:14:11:23 00:14:15:22 03:24
...because of the industry's emissions
of methane.

101:     00:14:16:00 00:14:20:09 04:09
This greenhouse gas has over 30 times
more impact than CO2.

102:     00:14:20:12 00:14:26:11 05:24
The extraction, processing, transport...

103:     00:14:26:14 00:14:32:08 05:19
...and the burning of gas
cause CO2 and methane emissions.

104:     00:14:32:11 00:14:36:20 04:09
Investing in infrastructure
for LNG transport...

105:     00:14:36:23 00:14:42:24 06:01
...is an incentive to continue
the extraction and use of natural gas.

106:     00:14:43:02 00:14:46:09 03:07
The LNG lobby prefers
to point at other polluters.

107:     00:15:09:13 00:15:13:06 03:18
ING have a similar response
to our questions.

108:     00:15:13:09 00:15:16:15 03:06
Compared to other fossil fuels
gas is clean.

109:     00:15:16:18 00:15:22:03 05:10
A necessary interim step on the way
to more renewable energy, they say.

110:     00:15:22:06 00:15:24:02 01:21
In a sense they are right.

111:     00:15:24:05 00:15:29:23 05:18
But that is very much dependent
on what gas you use.

112:     00:15:30:01 00:15:36:09 06:08
It usually is shale gas. Its extraction
is much more energy intensive...

113:     00:15:36:12 00:15:41:11 04:24
...and methane is a by-product. It is
transported over bigger distances.

114:     00:15:41:14 00:15:47:02 05:13
Then, it has to be liquefied.
This process is also energy intensive.

115:     00:15:47:05 00:15:53:02 05:22
Then, a carrier transports it across
the ocean, before we can use it here.

116:     00:15:53:05 00:15:59:14 06:09
That is a chain full of emissions.
The sum total is a lot more pollution.

117:     00:15:59:17 00:16:07:14 07:22
And methane emission reduction is more
urgent than CO2 emission reduction.

118:     00:16:07:17 00:16:11:12 03:20
During COP27 new figures
were presented that show...

119:     00:16:11:15 00:16:17:09 05:19
...that the oil and gas extraction in Texas
is the world's biggest methane source.

120:     00:16:17:12 00:16:21:02 03:15
Three times bigger
than the industry reports.

121:     00:16:21:05 00:16:26:16 05:11
The ING financed terminals
are fed from these fields.

122:     00:16:26:19 00:16:30:06 03:12
New exploration leads to more emissions.

123:     00:16:30:09 00:16:35:23 05:14
We need to stop drilling, both
in the US and in the Netherlands.

124:     00:16:36:01 00:16:41:08 05:07
If you build new pipelines in the chain...
Those need gas.

125:     00:16:42:10 00:16:46:02 03:17
ING does not rule out
ending its LNG involvement.

126:     00:16:46:05 00:16:52:08 06:03
But the timing depends on upcoming
advice on their portfolio's climate impact.

127:     00:16:52:11 00:16:55:19 03:08
You can find ING's response on pointer.nl.
