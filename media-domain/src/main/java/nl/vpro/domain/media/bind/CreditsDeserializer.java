/**
 * Resolves polymorphism of credits. Make sure to unmarshal as a {@link Person} if that is appropriate, and to {@link Name} otherwise.
 * <p>
 * Using {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeId} would have been possible too, but that would make the 'objectType' required, and we have to republish everything.
 * <p>
 * There is not real reason, it is simple to recognize by other fields wether we want a Person or not.
 * <p>
 * This class is added as a JsonDeserializer only on {@link Credits}, and to avoid infinite recursion, in all extensions this is overridden by the default again.
 * <p>
 * We do however include {@link Credits#getObjectType()} for the serializer, so other implementors (perhaps we in the future) may choose to switch on that after all.
